She championed full nutrition panels and dosing schedules before state mandates. Notably, Dedenbach convinced regulators to classify cannabutter as a concentrate, allowing higher dosages (up to 2000mg) when laws limited edibles to 100mg. Her background in confectionery enabled her to infuse tried-and-true recipes with precise cannabis doses, prioritizing consumer education and informed choices. Heavenly Sweet offers a variety of cannabutter strengths, using carefully selected strains and providing dosing instructions. Dedenbach also explains how edibles are metabolized differently in the body and cautions against overindulgence due to the liver's conversion of THC to a more potent form. The company's success is attributed to its focus on quality, consistency, and informed consumerism.\n\"\n\"Alpaca Club offers premium weed delivery in Arden, prioritizing quality and convenience.
